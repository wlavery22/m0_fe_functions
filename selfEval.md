# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
Still struggling with time management, things usually take longer than I think, I can budget more time, but there's a limit to that. I think I just need to learn to work and learn faster, and to ask for help sooner, and to know when to move on.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
A function is a way to tell a computer what to do. It has a name and the computer won't do it until you call that name. 
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
Parameters are like variables, they are placeholders for data, they tell the computer where to put the data. The arguments are the data itself. The number of arguments given must match the number of parameters declared.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to bring to your Small Group?
In this function, what are the parameters and the arguments?
function playAround() {
  console.log("Let's deepen our understanding...");
